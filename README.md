# vba_challenge
The solution file for the vba challenge is named as multiple_year_stock_solved.vba.   
I have attached alphabetical_testing.xlsm (test data)  completed run on my local file.

I made up stockdata_simplified_solved.xlsm to test further. It is also attached.
Also, there are screenshots of the multi_year_stock_data file after successful run.
